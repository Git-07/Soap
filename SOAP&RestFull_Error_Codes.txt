SOAP UI
1)Same problem for me on 4.5.1 Win 32. The proxy was enabled and set to port 8081. Disabling the proxy in Files->Preferences->Proxy Settings allowed it all to work.

2)In my case the server were the service was installed was configured only for TLS. SSL was not allowed. So you have to update SoapUI vmoptions file by adding

-Dsoapui.https.protocols=TLSv1.2
You can find vmoptions file under SoapUI installation folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.0.0\bin\soapUI-5.0.0.vmoptions
